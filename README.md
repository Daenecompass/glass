# Timeglass
Fully Automated Time Tracking for Git Repositories.

![Timeglass Screenshot](/../assets/assets/screenshot.png?raw=true "Timeglass Screenshot")

It uses hooks and file monitoring to make sure you'll never forget to start or stop your timer ever again. It is written in [Go](http://golang.org/) and runs 100% on your own workstation: no internet or account registration required. 

__Features:__

- The timer __automatically starts__ when you switch to a (new) branch using `git checkout`
- The timer __automatically pauses__ when it doesn't detect any file activity for a while
- The time you spent is automatically added to the next `git commit` message
- Time is incremented by a "minimal billable unit" (MBU), one minute by default. 

__Currently Supported (see roadmap):__

- Platforms: __OSX__
- Version Control: __Git__

## Getting Started
*coming soon*


## Roadmap, input welcome!

- __Configuration:__ including configuring the minimal billable unit, ignoring certain directories and configuring the commit message. _What else would you like to configure? input welcome [here](https://github.com/Timeglass/glass/issues/7)_
- __Querying:__ Having intimate knowledge of both the commits and the time it took to create them, opens up enormous potential for interesting data to be extracted. _What would you like to query for? Input welcome [here](https://github.com/Timeglass/glass/issues/9)_
- __Supporting Other VCS:__ Timeglass currently only works for git repositories, mainly due to the number of hooks it provides. _What other version control systems would you like to see implemented? Input welcome [here](https://github.com/Timeglass/glass/issues/10)_
- __Supporting other OSs:__ File monitoring is implemented differently across platforms. The current implementation uses FSEvents (OSX), let me know what other platforms you would like to see implemented [here](https://github.com/Timeglass/glass/issues/11)

## Known Issues

- __Handling `git stash`:__ Git has the ability to stash work for a later commit prior to switching branches. Currently the timer unable to detect this; adding extra time to next commit. Input welcome [here](https://github.com/Timeglass/glass/issues/3)
- __OS Restarts:__ Whenever the OS shuts down the repository might still contain uncommited work and a running timer, currently the timer is not restarted when this happens. _Input on how to achieve this is welcome [here](https://github.com/Timeglass/glass/issues/8)_
